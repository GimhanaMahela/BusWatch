# Stage 1: Build the React application
FROM node:20-alpine as build-stage

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
# This creates the optimized static assets in the 'build' folder
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the React application with a lightweight Nginx server
FROM nginx:alpine as production-stage

# Copy the built React app from the build-stage to Nginx's serving directory
COPY --from=build-stage /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy a custom Nginx configuration if you have one (optional, but good for SPA routing)
# For React Router, you'll need to configure Nginx to redirect all unmatched URLs to index.html
# Example:
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose the port Nginx listens on
EXPOSE 80

# Command to run Nginx (default command for nginx:alpine is fine)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
